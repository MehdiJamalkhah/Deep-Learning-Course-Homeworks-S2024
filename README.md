# Deep Learning Course Homeworks

This repository contains the completed homework assignments for the Deep Learning course at SUT, instructed by Dr. Soleymani.


### HW1: Deep Learning Basics
- **Optimization Methods**: 
In this notebook, we explore several optimization methods commonly employed in deep learning tasks and assess their effectiveness using two test functions.

- **NN From Scratch**:
In this notebook we will implement fully-connected networks using a modular approach. For each layer we will implement a `forward` and a `backward` function. The `forward` function will receive inputs, weights, and other parameters and will return both an output and a `cache` object storing data needed for the backward pass. The backward pass will receive upstream derivatives and the `cache` object, and will return gradients with respect to the inputs and weights.

- **Pytorch Basics**:
This notebook will walk you through many of the important features of PyTorch.
