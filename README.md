# Deep Learning Course Homeworks

This repository contains the completed homework assignments for the Deep Learning course at SUT, instructed by Dr. Soleymani.


### HW1: Deep Learning Basics
- **Optimization Methods**: 
In this notebook, we explore several optimization methods commonly employed in deep learning tasks and assess their effectiveness using two test functions.

- **NN From Scratch**:
In this notebook we will implement fully-connected networks using a modular approach. For each layer we will implement a `forward` and a `backward` function. The `forward` function will receive inputs, weights, and other parameters and will return both an output and a `cache` object storing data needed for the backward pass. The backward pass will receive upstream derivatives and the `cache` object, and will return gradients with respect to the inputs and weights.

- **Pytorch Basics**:
This notebook will walk you through many of the important features of PyTorch.


### HW2: Convolutional Neural Networks
- **Vanilla CNN**: 
In this notebook, to learn about CNNs basics we will be working on a problem of great importance in computer vision, classifying images of cats and dogs :).

- **ResNet and U-Net**:
In this notebook, we will implement the `ResNet18` and `U-Net` using PyTorch, and use them for image classification and colorization on the CIFAR10 dataset.

- **YOLO**:
In this notebook, you will implement the YOLO object detection algorithm using PyTorch. YOLO is a real-time object detection system that can recognize multiple objects in an image while also predicting their bounding boxes.
